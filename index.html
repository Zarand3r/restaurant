            <p>We are a small family owned and operated restaunt in the heart of Pasadena, the valley of roses.
              Founded in 1893 by the famous chef Robert A. Millikan, this establishment has been world renowned ever since!

            <h1 style = "width: 140px;">One of a Kind</h1>
            <p>When he was a starving child in the slums, Gordon wanted nothing more than to taste the wonderful, delicious cuisine
              crafted at the local restaunt. It was truly a golden age for fine dining. Master chefs crafted intricate recipes and transformed
              the trade into one of the most respected forms of art.</p>
            <p>Gordon was inspired to pursue a career in the culinary industry, and studied under many famous and influential chefs.
              For countless hours he would labor in the kitchen without any pay, but he never lost focus, and was always hungry to learn.
              He became bitter and angry but this gave him more flavor. He became obssessed with seasoning his food in the same way he had been
              seasoned by the many obstacles he had faced in life. At the end, it made him stronger, more delicious!</p>
